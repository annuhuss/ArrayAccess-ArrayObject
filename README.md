<h1>
Utilizing the features of PHPs predefined ArrayAccess interface and ArrayObject class by a container
</h1>

<p>
<em>PHP</em> ships with a number of predefined classes and interfaces and, two of the common are <i>ArrayAccess</i> interface and <i>ArrayObject</i> class. Specially, these two can be very handy whenever you want to function them for an object so that the object acts like an array. Briefly, if you want to construct an object in your application that needs to play the role as like an array, you can achieve that by the aid of built in <i>ArrayAccess</i> interface and <i>ArrayObject</i> class. As a result, you may have access to the features of an array either by implementing or extending these built in interface and class respectively depending on what kinds of features the object needed to perform in your application.
</p>

<p>
The <i>ArrayAccess</i> interface has four abstract methods which are <i>ArrayAccess::offsetExists</i>, <i>ArrayAccess::offsetSet</i>, <i>ArrayAccess::offsetGet</i>, and <i>ArrayAccess::offsetUnset</i>. Additionally, these methods must be defined by the implementing object. On the other hand, by default, <i>ArrayObject</i> class itself implements <i>IteratorAggregate</i>, <i>ArrayAccess</i>, <i>Serializable</i> and <i>Countable</i> interfaces. Consequently, the object which extends <i>ArrayObject</i> class now have almost all the functionalities alike arrays. But if the object does not have some of them directly then, you need to do some tricks to get those such as, access to array's library functions by the object needed some extra effort.

OK, let's now talk about the intention of this article as its title demands. Although it is not always suggested but I am so obsessed about using container in my last few articles that, all the examples I am going to introduce here are also based on containers. Firstly, I will discuss on an example which intentionally produces some errors or notices for using PHP <i><strong>unset()</i></strong> and <i><strong>shuffle()</i></strong> functions by the container object. Secondly I will show, how to mitigate the problems faced in the first example by implementing <i>ArrayAccess</i> interface with aid of the container object. In the final example I will convey, how to make the Container object more stable by extending the <i>ArrayObject</i> class so that it can perform on maximum number of features that an array offers.
</p>

<p>
At first I have constructed the Container class with the support of two PHP magic methods <i><strong>__set()</strong></i> and <i><strong>__get()</strong></i> which initially handle setting and getting properties for the Container object. You can find more details about these two methods by this <i><a href="https://php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.magic.php/">Link</a></i>. The motive of this example is that, I want to execute some regular flights through some terminals in a busy airport for performing all the specific tasks which are exclusively handled by the container object. For that reason, I want to use <i>unset()</i> and <i>shuffle()</i> functions to control the most upcoming flights from a flights schedules by the limited terminals in some random fashion. But the problem here is that, by the support of these <i>__set()</i> and <i>__get()</i> methods, the Container object is unable to perform the tasks unlike an array which can be seen by the following PHP snippet of code:
</p>

```php
 class Container
{
	protected $data = array();

	function __set($k, $v)
	{
		$this->data[$k] = $v; 
	}

	function __get($k) 
	{ 
		if (!isset($this->data[$k]))
    		{
      			throw new Exception(sprintf('Key "%s" does not exists.', $k));
    		}
		return is_callable($this->data[$k])? $this->data[$k]($this) : $this->data[$k];
	}
}

$c = new Container();

$c->flights = ['Flight_A', 'Flight_B', 'Flight_C', 'Flight_D', 'Flight_E'];
$c->terminals = ['Terminal_1', 'Terminal_2', 'Terminal_3'];

if(isset($c->flights[1]))
{
	unset($c->flights[1]);
}

if(isset($c->flights[4]))
{
	unset($c->flights[4]);
}

shuffle($c->flights);
shuffle($c->terminals); 
```
<p>
In this case, when using <i>unset()</i> and <i>shuffle()</i> functions by the object, the program produces the notices: <i>"Indirect modification of overloaded property has no effect â€¦"</i>.
</p>

<p>
The examples in PHP below are mainly focused on to the operation for implementing <i>ArrayAccess</i> interface and extending <i>ArrayObject</i> class by a container.
</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li><strong>incorrect_example.php</strong></li>
<li><strong>ArrayAccess.php</strong></li>
<li><strong>ArrayObject.php</strong></li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
By the example <i>ArrayAccess.php</i> we now have solved the problem and by <i>ArrayObject.php</i>, an object now have greater access to the functionalities which an array does.
